        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>This project uses matrix math in Javascript to simulate the effect of quantum logic gates. The program allows the user to create a series of quantum logic and pass their choice of qubits through it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>Warning:</h2>
        <p>The time taken to process the quantum logic gates increases exponentially with the number of qubits. The program is not optimized for large numbers of qubits.</p>

        <h2>How to use:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the website listed under the demo. <a href="https://ryanlatimer.github.io/Quantum-Computer-Simulation">Click here.</a></li>
            <li>Create a series of logic gates and input the qubits you want to pass through the logic to simulate quantum logic.</li>
            <li>View the results of the simulation in text and graphical form.</li>
            <li>Create another simulation.</li>

        <h2>Real World Application:</h2>
        <p>As of now, quantum computers exist but they must be kept at extremely low temperatures, and still have a large amount of error (where the qubit randomly switches its value). Simulations of this logic allow quantum circuits to be tested on classical computers. However, these simulations cannot be used to solve quantum problems due to the exponentially increasing resource cost. They provide a way for researchers to verify their simulation, or to experiment with different types of quantum gates and logic.</p>
